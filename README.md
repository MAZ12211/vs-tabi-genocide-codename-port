# vs-tabi-genocide-codename-port
Codename port of the song Genocide along with a retrospecter remix of the song <br>
If you have a hard time playing the port in terms of performance look for Genocide port in Options.
If the songs are too hard to beat, switch difficulties.

# to-dos
- [ ] Rechart retrospecter remix
- [x] Look into Genocide's chart for potential offsync notes?
- [ ] Upload to Youtube for showcase
- [ ] Upload to gamebanana maybe?
- [x] bad Opponent mode? Won't happen sadly. Too dumb.
